# Placement Analysis using ML Project

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze placement data using machine learning techniques. It involves the development of a predictive model to assess the likelihood of a student getting placed based on various factors such as academic performance, skill set, and personal attributes. The project leverages machine learning algorithms to train a model on historical placement data, enabling it to make predictions on new data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing information about students and their placement outcomes. The dataset consists of the following columns:

- `Gender`: Gender of the student (Categorical: Male/Female)
- `SSC Percentage`: Percentage obtained in the Secondary School Certificate (Numeric)
- `HSC Percentage`: Percentage obtained in the Higher Secondary Certificate (Numeric)
- `Stream of Educcation`: Which stream the student is from (Categorical)
- `Degree Percentage`: Percentage obtained in the undergraduate degree (Numeric)
- `Work Experience`: Whether the student has work experience (Categorical: Yes/No)
- `Specialization`: Which specialization the student pursued (Categorical)
- `Placement Status`: Placement outcome (Categorical: Placed/Not Placed)
- `Salary`: Salary at which the student was placed (Numeric)

## Project Structure
The project repository consists of the following files:

- `Placement_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code.
- `Placement_Data_Full_Class.csv`: CSV file containing the placement data.

## Results
The project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a student getting placed based on various factors. The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The notebook provides visualizations and insights to help interpret the results.
